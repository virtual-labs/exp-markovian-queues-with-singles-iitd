      "question": "Number of customers arriving in a unit time in the system is represented by?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Mean arrival rate",
        "b": "Mean service rate",
        "c": "Simulation speed",
        "d": "Start"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Mean arrival rate is defined as number of arrivals per unit time",
        "b": "Mean service rate is defined as number of customers served per unit time",
        "c": "Simulation speed is the extent of speed with which simulation of experiment is performed",
        "d": "Start is used to simulate the experiment for the given values of parameters"

    {
      "question": "What is the relationship between mean arrival rate and mean service rate for the existence of a steady-state solution?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Mean arrival rate = Mean service rate",
        "b": "Mean arrival rate > Mean service rate",
        "c": "Mean arrival rate < Mean service rate",
        "d": "Mean service rate is independent of mean arrival rate for the existence of steady state solution"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "For mean arrival rate equals to mean service rate, traffic intensity equals to 1, which leads infinite number of customers in the system",
        "b": "In this case, system will collapse due to more arrival in comparison to service in a unit time",
        "c": "This leads to steady state solution as arrivals are less than service in a unit time",
        "d": "In this case, system will collapse due to more arrival in comparison to service in a unit time when arrival rate becomes greater than service rate"
      },

      "question": "Little's law defines the relationship between which of the following measures?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Mean arrival rate and mean service rate",
        "b": "Mean arrival rate and traffic intensity",
        "c": "Mean sevice rate and traffic intensity",
        "d": "Average number of customers in the system and waiting time in the system"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "d": "According to Little's law average number of a customer in the system is mean arrival rate times waiting time of a customer in the system"

      "question": "In a barber shop run by one barber, the queueing model will be best suited is?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Single server model",
        "b": "Multi server model",
        "c": "Single server with markovian arrival model",
        "d": "Multi server with markovian arrival model"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "c": "Since the customers are served by one man and the service of future state depend on the present state irrespective of the past state"
