      "explanations": {
        "a": "Mean arrival rate is defined as number of arrivals per unit time",
        "b": "Mean service rate is defined as number of customers served per unit time",
        "c": "Simulation speed is the extent of speed with which simulation of experiment is performed",
        "d": "Start is used to simulate the experiment for the given values of parameters"

      "question": "What is the relationship between mean arrival rate and mean service rate for the existence of a steady-state solution?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Mean arrival rate = Mean service rate",
        "b": "Mean arrival rate > Mean service rate",
        "c": "Mean arrival rate < Mean service rate",
        "d": "Mean service rate is independent of mean arrival rate for the existence of steady state solution"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "For mean arrival rate equals to mean service rate, traffic intensity equals to 1, which leads infinite number of customers in the system",
        "b": "In this case, system will collapse due to more arrival in comparison to service in a unit time",
        "c": "This leads to steady state solution as arrivals are less than service in a unit time",
        "d": "As 'c' is correct, this is not correct option"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
