      "question": "Consider a unisex hair salon where customers are served on a first-come, first-served basis. The data show that customers arrive according to a Poisson process with a mean arrival rate of 5 customers per hour. Because of its excellent reputation, customers are always willing to wait. The data further show that the customer processing time is exponentially distributed with an average of 10 minutes per customer. This system can be modeled as a M/M/1 queueing system. Then, in the long run, what is the average number of customers in the shop?",

      "explanations": {
        "b": "$X_t$ be the random variable denoting the number of customers in the salon at any time $t$. Then the system can be modeled as a M/M/l queueing system with ${X_t;t > 0}$ as the underlying stochastic process. Here, arrival rate is 5 customers per hour, and service rate is 6 customers per hour. Hence, $$\rho =\frac{5}{6}$$. Thus the average number of customers in the shop is $$L= \frac{\rho}{1-\rho}= 5$$"

      "question": "Consider the New Delhi International Airport. Assume that it has one runway which is used for arrivals only. Airplanes have been found to arrive at a rate of 10 per hour. The time (in minutes) taken for an airplane to land is assumed to follow exponential distribution with mean 3 minutes. Assume that arrivals follow the Poisson process.
