To conduct the experiment for the M/M/1 queueing model, follow these detailed steps in sequence:

1. **Configure Simulation Parameters**:
   - **Set Mean Arrival Rate**: Input the average rate at which customers arrive at the system.
   - **Set Mean Service Rate**: Input the average rate at which the server processes customers.

2. **Verify Steady-State Conditions**:
   - **Ensure Stability**: Confirm that the mean arrival rate is less than the mean service rate. This condition is necessary for the system to have steady distribution where the system can handle incoming customers without the queue growing indefinitely.

3. **Adjust Simulation Speed**:
   - **Set Simulation Speed**: Choose the desired simulation speed. Adjusting this setting allows you to control the pace of the simulation for detailed observation or quicker results.

4. **Start the Experiment**:
   - **Begin Simulation**: Click the 'Start' button to initiate the simulation. The system will simulate customer arrivals, service processes, and departures based on the parameters you have set.

5. **Stop the Experiment and View Results**:
   - **End Simulation**: Once sufficient data has been collected, click the 'Stop' button to halt the simulation.
   - **Examine Results**: Review the steady-state results displayed both numerically and graphically. These results will include metrics such as the average number of customers in the system, the average waiting time, and the server utilization rate.

6. **Compare Results**:
   - **Analyze and Validate**: Compare the experimental results obtained from the simulation with the theoretical predictions of the M/M/1 model. This comparison helps to validate the theoretical model and provides insights into the system's performance under various conditions.
